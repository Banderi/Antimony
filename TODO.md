- [ ] Optimization
	- [ ] 3D
		- [ ] Buffer collection
- [ ] Documentation
	- [ ] Decent commenting
	- [ ] Wiki
	- [ ] Examples

### Bugs:
- [x] Fix keyboard input setting to '1' repeatedly
- [x] Fix camera interpolation
- [x] Fix high framerate usage by the debug renderer -- compiling with `release` optimization gives expected results for the moment
- [x] Fix character controller collisions
- [ ] Fix platform movements (completely)
- [ ] Fix developer console display

### Roadmap:
- [ ] Get basic gameplay engine working, test some assets against it
- [ ] Develop testing build
- [ ] Polish github/create dedicated website
- [ ] Develop prototype working game
- [ ] Sell on Steam
- [ ] Develop multiple gameplays
- [ ] Implement Steam Workshop
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit

### Possible future plans:
- Implement multiplatform support
- Look into Vulkan support
- Look into mobile/legacy systems
- Handshake with Jon Stewart
